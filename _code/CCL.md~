## Summary
This package calculates numerous quantities related to galaxy clusters, including those that are essential for modeling weak lensing profiles. This includes 3D and 2D projected density profiles, 1- and 2- halo terms, correlation functions, the halo bias, and the halo mass function. All implementations are extremely optimized and are suitable for use in an MCMC analysis.
