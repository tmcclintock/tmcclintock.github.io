Designed and delivered lectures introducing students to the principles of scientific computing. No prior programming knowledge was assumed. The class was taught in C and Python, and algorithms included numerical integration, data visualization, and basic animation. Emphasis was placed on working with physical systems familiar to the students from physics classes offered concurrently.
