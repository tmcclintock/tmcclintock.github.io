Galaxy clusters live in dark matter halos. Assuming a spherical matter distribution, the halo density profile can be described with two numbers: the **mass** $M$ and **concentration** $c$. This is the first in a series of posts going through the basic maths behind dealing with density profiles. Here, I will go over how the concentration is defined mathematically.

The mass of a halo is written in terms of the overdensity $$\Delta$$ of the halo above the background:

$$M_\Delta = \Delta \frac{4\pi}{3}R_\Delta^3\rho_m\,.$$

In other words, if we draw a sphere of radius $$R_\Delta$$ around the halo, then the mass in that sphere is $$M_\Delta$$ and it is $$\Delta$$ times more dense than the matter density $$\rho_m$$. For simplicity, we will drop the $$\Delta$$ from here on, but the choice of overdensity depends on what the goals of a given analysis. Common choices are 200, 500, and the virial radii $$R_{\rm vir}$$. For this post, the definition doesn't matter.

The **density profile** $$\rho(r,M)$$, or the distribution of matter within the halo, is some function of halo mass. Following the previous equation, we can integrate the profile out to $$R$$ to recover the mass:

$$M = \int {\rm d}^3\vec{x}\ \rho(r) = 4\pi\int_0^R {\rm d}r\ r^2\rho(r)\,.$$

At this point, one has to assume some model for $$\rho(r,M)$$ in order to glean more information about halos. A very common choice of density profiles is the [NFW profile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navarro%E2%80%93Frenk%E2%80%93White_profile), which has the simple form:

$$\rho(r) = \frac{\rho_0}{\frac{r}{r_s}\left(1+\frac{r}{r_s}\right)^2}\,,$$

where $$\rho_0$$ is a normalization and $$r_s$$ is the "scale radius". The scale radius depends on mass, and describes the shape of the profile. Looking again at equation (2), we see that we can plug in equation (3):

$$ M = 4\pi\rho_0\int_0^R {\rm d}r\ \frac{r^2}{\frac{r}{r_s}\left(1+\frac{r}{r_s}\right)^2}$$

At this point, we can make a convenient substitution $$x = r/r_s$$. This finally brings us to the **definition of concentration**: $$c = R/r_s$$ (the upper limit of the integral). In other words, the concentration is the halo radius in units of the scale radius. An important point lost on many is that the definition of the concentration is always the same, but its exact value is *model dependent*. So one can only know a concentration given a halo definition $$\Delta$$ and particular density model (e.g. NFW).

Using the substitution previously mentioned, we can rewrite our integral:

$$M = 4\pi r_s^3\rho_0\int_0^{c}{\rm d}{x}\ \frac{x}{(1+x)^2}\,.$$

Solving this is pretty simple, leaving us with a nice relation between mass, concentration, and the normalization:

$$M = 4\pi r_s^3\rho_0\left[\ln(1+c)-\frac{c}{1+c}\right]\,.$$

In cluster analyses that use the NFW profile, the free parameters are the mass and concentration, and the normalization is just given by equation (6). The figure below shows an example of the NFW density profile at fixed mass $$M=10^{13}\ {\rm M_\odot}$$ as a function of concentration.

If your data isn't powerful enough to constrain both, a good alternative is to use mass--concentration relations to write $$c(M)$$.

We'll get into all that and more in future posts in this series. Next time, we will look at how we can relate free parameters in different density profiles to one another.
