Designed and delivered lectures introducing students to the principles of scientific computing, most of which had no prior programming experience. I taught the class in C and Python, and covered algorithms including numerical integration, data visualization, and basic animation. I emphasized working with physical systems familiar to the students from classes offered concurrently.

I served as the primary instructor for the Fall 2015 semester, and in the previous semesters as the TA. Outside the classroom my responsibilities included responding to student inquiries, holding office hours, and grading homeworks and final projects.
