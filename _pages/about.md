:math:`y=mx_b`. Hello! I am a postdoctoral researcher at Brookhaven National Lab in the astrophysics group. I completed my PhD at the University of Arizona working under Professor [Eduardo Rozo](http://w3.physics.arizona.edu/people/eduardo-rozo). I also completed a MSc in high performance computing at the University of Edinburgh, and obtained my BA from Amherst College.

I strongly advocate for inclusiveness and a positive student experience in research.

My research interests are varied, but my primary focus is on galaxy clusters and gravitational weak lensing. I also work on developing machine learning techniques to leverage the power of large cosmological simulations. On the side, I dabble in modeling Mars ice deposits as well as the physics of frisbee flights.

I am currently a member of the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration, and am the cluster weak lensing co-lead in the Dark Energy Survey.

Feel free to contact me if you are intersted in working together.
