In this talk I discussed the work done in McClintock+ (2018a,b) and in my PhD thesis. I presented our constraints on the mass--richness relation of redMaPPer clusters identified in the Dark Energy Survey, and discussed systematics relevant to those at Fermilab including mass bias, projection effects, and cluster centering. Lastly, I presented my emulator for the halo mass function and teased new emulators under construction for the halo bais and halo-matter correlation function.
