I presented these slidse at the [South American Workshop on Cosmology in the LSST Era](http://www.ictp-saifr.org/south-american-workshop-on-cosmology-in-the-lsst-era/), where I connected the efforts of collaborations such as DES to what will be required during LSST for cluster cosmology. Overall, the workshop was a blast, and you can find a link to a video of my presentation as well as the other speakers on [this page](http://www.ictp-saifr.org/south-american-workshop-on-cosmology-in-the-lsst-era/).
