In this colloquium I gave a non-technical talk geared toward the undergrad physics majors in the audience about cosmology, galaxy clusters, and survey science. I start with the obligatory introduction about what cosmology is (the study of the Universe), what kind of things we care about (expansion history and formation of the large scale structure), and how galaxy clusters can help answer these questions. I show some cool videos of dark matter halos and galaxy clusters in different simulations, relating what we see on the sky and in the sims to the physics we are trying to understand. Finally, I touch briefly on weak gravitational lensing from clusters and how it's used to measure cluster masses, before giving a pitch to the students to think about survey science in the future.

This talk includes three movies, which are embedded as links to where they are hosted on Google drive. You might not have access to them, but they are the Millenium fly-through video, the 4-panel Eagle simulation of a galaxy cluster, and a LSS formation video made by Matt Becker (ANL). The first two can be located online, but for the last one might have to contact Matt directly.
