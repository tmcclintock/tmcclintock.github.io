In this poster I highlighted the work done in McClintock+ (2018a,b). I showed preliminary results of our constraints on the cluster mass--richness relation from DES weak lensing data around redMaPPer galaxy clusters. Additionally, I detailed how we dealt with the numerous sources of systematic error on both the lensing and mass estimation sides. Then I show the halo mass function emulator I constructed, and finally leave off with section slide showing early cosmology results from the re-analysis of SDSS redMaPPer clusters.
