## Summary
Constrained the richness--mass scaling relation of redMaPPer galaxy clusters identified in the Dark Energy Survey.

## Contribution
I did the lensing analysis and measured the mass--richness scaling relations. Additionally, I computed the mass bias by running the analysis pipeline on simulated results.

## Abstract
We use weak-lensing shear measurements to determine the mean mass of optically selected galaxy clusters in Dark Energy Survey Science Verification data. In a blinded analysis, we split the sample of more than 8000 redMaPPer clusters into 15 subsets, spanning ranges in the richness parameter 5 ≤ λ ≤ 180 and redshift 0.2 ≤ z ≤ 0.8, and fit the averaged mass density contrast profiles with a model that accounts for seven distinct sources of systematic uncertainty: shear measurement and photometric redshift errors; cluster-member contamination; miscentring; deviations from the NFW halo profile; halo triaxiality and line-of-sight projections. We combine the inferred cluster masses to estimate the joint scaling relation between mass, richness and redshift, M(λ ,z) ∝ M_0 λ F (1+z)G. We find M_0 ≡ < M_{200m} | λ =30,z=0.5 \rangle =[ 2.35 ± 0.22 {(stat)} ± 0.12 {(sys)} ] × 10^{14} M_{⊙}, with F = 1.12 ± 0.20 {(stat)} ± 0.06 {(sys)} and G = 0.18 ± 0.75 {(stat)} ± 0.24 {(sys)}. The amplitude of the mass-richness relation is in excellent agreement with the weak-lensing calibration of redMaPPer clusters in SDSS by Simet et al. and with the Saro et al. calibration based on abundance matching of SPT-detected clusters. Our results extend the redshift range over which the mass-richness relation of redMaPPer clusters has been calibrated with weak lensing from z ≤ 0.3 to z ≤ 0.8. Calibration uncertainties of shear measurements and photometric redshift estimates dominate our systematic error budget and require substantial improvements for forthcoming studies.
